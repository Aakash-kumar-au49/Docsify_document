### To add more pages
If you need more pages, you can simply create more markdown files in your docsify directory.  
Example:
In the docsify directory create a file named intro.md:
```
touch introduction.md
```
you can edit the intro.md file by the following command  
```
vim introduction.md
```
# Configuration
All core configuration for docsify is done in the index.html file using the window.$docsify script object.
## Sidebar
In order to have a sidebar, you can create your own '_sidebar.md.'First, you need to set loadSidebar to true.
```<!-- index.html -->

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadSidebar: true
  }
</script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
```
Create _sidebar.md,In the root of your documentation folder, create a file named _sidebar.md. This file will contain the structure of your sidebar. For example:
```
- [Home](README.md)
- [Draft Article](draft-article.md)
- [Guide](guide.md)
- [intro](intro.md)
- [Second](page-second.md)
- [Third](page-third.md)
- [Four](page-four.md)

```
After making these changes, when you run Docsify, you should see a sidebar on the left side of your documentation with the structure specified in the _sidebar.md file.

## hideSidebar
This option will completely hide your sidebar and won't render any content on the side.
```
window.$docsify = {
  hideSidebar: true,
};
```

## coverPage
You can set a cover page by setting the coverpage to true and creating a _coverpage.md file in your docsify directory.
* Create a "_coverpage.md" file in your docsify directory.
* Add the content of coverpage in Markdown format 
Example
```
<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    coverpage: true
  }
</script>
```
```
<!-- _coverpage.md -->

- Multiple themes
```


## homepage
README.md in your docs folder will be treated as the homepage for your website, but sometimes you may need to serve another file as your homepage.


```
window.$docsify = {
  // Change to /home.md
  homepage: 'home.md',

  // Or use the readme in your repo
  homepage:
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsifyjs/docsify/master/README.md',
};
```

## name
Website name as it appears in the top of sidebar.
```
window.$docsify = {
  name: 'docsify',
};
```
## nameLink
The URL that the website name links to.
```
window.$docsify = {
  nameLink: '/',

  // For each route
  nameLink: {
    '/zh-cn/': '#/zh-cn/',
    '/': '#/',
  },
};
```

## customNavbar
you can create a custom markdown-based navigation file by setting loadNavbar to true and creating "_navbar.md" in your docsify directory
To create the "_navbar.md":
```
cd docsify
touch _navbar.md
```
Edit the _navbar.md as per your requirement For example
```
<!-- _navbar.md -->

* [Hindi](/)
* [English](/En/)
```
To see the changes edit your html file to loadNavbar:true
```
<!-- index.html -->

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadNavbar: true
  }
</script>
```

## repo
Configure the repository url, or a string of username/repo, to add the GitHub Corner widget in the top right corner of the site.
```
window.$docsify = {
  repo: 'docsifyjs/docsify',
  // or
  repo: 'https://github.com/Aakash-kumar-au49',
};
```

## nativeEmoji
Render emoji shorthand codes using GitHub-style emoji images or platform-native emoji characters.
```
window.$docsify = {
  nativeEmoji: true,
};
```
> Markdown

```
## externalLinkTarget
This configuration allows you to control how users navigate when clicking on external links in your Docsify documentation. If you prefer to keep users within the same tab when clicking external links, using '_self' is the appropriate setting. If you want external links to open in a new tab (the default behavior), you can omit this configuration or set it to '_blank'.
```
window.$docsify = {
  externalLinkTarget: '_self', // default: '_blank'
};
```
## maxLevel
This configuration sets the maximum TOC level to 4. It means that only headings up to level 4 will be included in the automatically generated Table of Contents. Headings are typically denoted by the number of hash symbols (#) in Markdown, with a single hash (#) representing an H1 heading, two hashes (##) for H2, and so on.

```
window.$docsify = {
  // Set the maximum TOC level to 4
  maxLevel: 4,
};

```
## mergeNavbar
This option allows you to control the behavior of the navigation bar (navbar) and the sidebar on smaller screens.

Here's an explanation of your example:
```
window.$docsify = {
  // Merge the navbar with the sidebar on smaller screens
  mergeNavbar: true,
};

```

## Themes
There is a handful of themes available, both official and community-made. Copy Vue and buble website custom theme and @liril-net contribution to the theme of the black style.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/vue.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/buble.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/dark.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/themes/pure.css" />
```
## themecolor
Using the themeColor option allows you to match the color scheme of your Docsify documentation with your branding or design preferences. Make sure to choose a color that complements your overall visual style.
```
window.$docsify = {
  // Customize the theme color to '#3F51B5'
  themeColor: '#3F51B5',
};

```

# Markdown
Alternatively, you can create a custom markdown-based navigation file by setting loadNavbar to true and creating _navbar.md, compare loadNavbar configuration.
   - window.$docsify: This is an object used to configure Docsify settings.
   - loadNavbar: true: Enables the loading of a custom navigation bar.
   ```
   <!-- index.html -->

<script>
  // Set Docsify configuration
  window.$docsify = {
    loadNavbar: true, // Enable loading of the custom navigation bar
  };
</script>

<!-- Include Docsify library -->
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>

   ```
   ```
   <!-- _navbar.md -->

* [En](/)          <!-- Link to the English version, pointing to the root -->
* [Hindi](Hindi.md)  <!-- Link to the hindi version, / -->

```
This approach allows you to have a custom navigation structure defined in a Markdown file, giving you more control over the organization of your documentation site. Users can navigate between sections easily using the links provided in the custom navigation bar.

## Markdown usage
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting and styling plain text. In the context of Docsify, a documentation site generator, Markdown serves as the primary language for creating and formatting content. Here are some common uses of Markdown in Docsify:

#### Document Formatting:
Markdown is used for structuring and formatting documentation content. Headings, paragraphs, lists, and other text formatting elements are easily created using Markdown syntax.
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2

```
#### Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting:

Markdown allows you to include code blocks, and Docsify supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
```
```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, Docsify!");
}

```
#### Emphasis and Styling:

Markdown allows you to apply emphasis, bold text, and other styles to enhance the visual presentation of your content
```
*Italic*
**Bold**

```
These are just a few examples of how Markdown is utilized in Docsify. Markdown's simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for creating documentation content, and Docsify enhances the experience by providing additional features such as automatic sidebar generation and integrated searching.

# List of Plugins
## Full text search
By default, the hyperlink on the current page is recognized and the content is saved in localStorage. You can also specify the path to the files.
```
<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    search: 'auto', // default

    search: [
      '/',            // => /README.md
      '/guide',       // => /guide.md
      '/get-started', // => /get-started.md
      '/zh-cn/',      // => /zh-cn/README.md
    ],

    // complete configuration parameters
    search: {
      maxAge: 86400000, // Expiration time, the default one day
      paths: [], // or 'auto'
      placeholder: 'Type to search',

      // Localization
      placeholder: {
        '/zh-cn/': '搜索',
        '/': 'Type to search',
      },

      noData: 'No Results!',

      // Localization
      noData: {
        '/zh-cn/': '找不到结果',
        '/': 'No Results',
      },

      // Headline depth, 1 - 6
      depth: 2,

      hideOtherSidebarContent: false, // whether or not to hide other sidebar content

      // To avoid search index collision
      // between multiple websites under the same domain
      namespace: 'website-1',

      // Use different indexes for path prefixes (namespaces).
      // NOTE: Only works in 'auto' mode.
      //
      // When initialiazing an index, we look for the first path from the sidebar.
      // If it matches the prefix from the list, we switch to the corresponding index.
      pathNamespaces: ['/zh-cn', '/ru-ru', '/ru-ru/v1'],

      // You can provide a regexp to match prefixes. In this case,
      // the matching substring will be used to identify the index
      pathNamespaces: /^(\/(zh-cn|ru-ru))?(\/(v1|v2))?/,
    },
  };
</script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/search.min.js"></script>
```
## Emoji

Renders a larger collection of emoji shorthand codes. Without this plugin, Docsify is able to render only a limited number of emoji shorthand codes.
```
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/emoji.min.js"></script>
```

## External Script

If the script on the page is an external one (imports a js file via src attribute), you'll need this plugin to make it work.

```
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify/lib/plugins/external-script.min.js"></script>
```
